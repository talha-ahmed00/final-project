Hi! Sorry for the late submission. 
This is my final project Submission for Blockchain Bootcamp.

The dApp researchplus enables user to submit a form and get an ERC20 token (TAS), The project is made by using replit and uses some code from Alchemy's Buy me a Coffee dApp Tutorial.

researchplus contract address = 0x31356c9DA942A9820E8199D4C61e3e281e8aCF23
TAS token address = 0x24f915F25Ad6888c70adf3e567d0c9dc812FAacB 

You can check out live project at https://researchplus.talha-ahmed00.repl.co/ , UI is very simple because I did'nt got a lot of time to style it, but I'll do it in the future.
